Mockup TinyMCE settings: Fix URLs in TinyMCE external_plugins settings.

Add the portal URL to external_plugins values for relative and absolute
URLs.

Before this fix external plugins could not be found if they were not added with
the full path or a full URL. The path is different for virtual hosted sites and
sites directly served from Zope.
