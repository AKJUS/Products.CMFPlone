Redirection view: refactor our navigation root editing to a separate method ``edit_for_navigation_root``.
Since Plone 5.2 the redirectiontool respects INavigationroot:
with a manual redirect you cannot enter a path starting with ``/`` which 'escapes' the NavigationRoot to the SiteRoot to link to another part of the Plone instance.
This refactor makes it possible to override this method to return the redirection unchanged, brining back the pre Plone 5.2 behavior of the ``Products.RedirectionTool`` add-on.
